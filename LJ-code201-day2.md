# LJ Code 201 - Day 2 July 11, 2017

Day 1 was a good day covering the basics and taking care of housekeeping to get the course started. We looked at an overview of the course and this weeks material. GIT will probably be the most challenging but I feel a little better about it after day 2, ACP, ACP, ACP. It will be tough to remember to commit and push often instead of just coding. I'm really happy for the prework and getting my computer set up and running with no problems so far. The knowledge gained in the prework is coming to an end though and then things will get pretty tough and fast paced.

Day 2 was great because we got to do some coding. My favorite part is using GIT, have no idea how it works yet but it is amazing, couldn't imagine not having it. Also got a better understanding of structure and how different headers should be used.

I need WAY more practice with css, just a matter of learning the syntax. I definitely prefer spending time with javascript than css and html.
