# LJ Code 201 - Day 4 July 13, 2017

### July 12
Yesterday was a long day, we worked with while loops and nested for loops.  I definitely learned that multiple if statements in a for loop can cause problems because each will evaluate once before the for loop cycles. I guess this can probably be good in the right situations.

I also learned the importance of walking it out, talking it out, or pseudo coding it out if your stuck.  Every time I was stuck, talking it through helped.

Today was a good day, started using functions but just inserted old code into them so it wasn't too bad. The biggest challenge was using GIT.  Not that it is hard but if conflicts arise it seems difficult to correct.  Definitely need to work towards mastering GITHub...watch videos, experiment a bunch, maybe take an online course on it? I think being comfortable with GITHub will make 301 and 401 much easier.  

It was also a good day for CSS, its starting to click a little bit.  The most frustrating part is not knowing exactly what I can do with it. I think looking over some examples will be good.

Positioning:
* normal flow
* relative Positioning
* absolute Positioning
* fixed Positioning
* floating Positioning
