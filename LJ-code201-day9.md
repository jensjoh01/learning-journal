# LJ Code 201 - Day 9 July 21, 2017

Spent the last few days working more with objects and tables. We also started working with event handlers and listeners which added a layer of complexity to the salmon cookies project.

Also still learning about the prototype function and how that all works but I know Object Oriented Programming is basically a must know to get a job so I'm glad we're spending a lot of time on them.
