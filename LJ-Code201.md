# Learning Journal Code 201

### Day 11 - Monday July 24
Covered CSS for the wireframe project. It was a good review, can always use some CSS practice. Lab for the day was starting bus mall; an application that displays three pictures and tracks which picture the user clicks on.  I was able to complete it but with very messy, wet (with extra text; opposite of dry; just made that up..) code.

I used a new function to track which image was clicked...there has to be a better way...

### Day 12 - Tuesday July 25
* review code
* make my bus mall dry
* use chartjs to make bar chart

### Day 13 - Wednesday July 26
* Learned indexof and includes for handling arrays
* talked about persistence
* local storage w/ JSON

  Working with local storage:
  variable -> stringify it -> store it

To get it:
getItem('key') -> parse it -> assign it where you want it.

When working with object arrays like Image.all, you need to parse using 'key' or else the '.' in name will screw it up:

JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('key')) instead of first getting it and then JSON.parse(<name>)

### Day 14
* Worked with a partner to create an order form and a shopping cart page for bus mall.

This ended up being a lot harder than I expected.  We really fumbled our way through linking our 3 JS pages together (could of used 2).  It was one of those assignments when I finished that I wasn't 100% sure what actually made it work. If I have time I should go back and review it.

### Day 15
Project teams and git merge conflicts.  Git merge conflicts are much easier to deal with using .md files than actual code but the exercise was definitely useful. It's nice to see that even when trying to break git it really isnt that hard to fix.  Got a start on our project but we need to do some feasibility testing...We're not clear on what we want the outcome to be so pretty difficult to plan in that case.

### Day 16
