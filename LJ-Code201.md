# Learning Journal Code 201

### Day 11 - Monday July 24
Covered CSS for the wireframe project. It was a good review, can always use some CSS practice. Lab for the day was starting bus mall; an application that displays three pictures and tracks which picture the user clicks on.  I was able to complete it but with very messy, wet (with extra text; opposite of dry; just made that up..) code.

I used a new function to track which image was clicked...there has to be a better way...
