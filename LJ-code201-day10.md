Hoisting
* JS makes 2 passes thru the code
    1. Gather Info (Hoisting)
        * Variable names are loaded into memory (no assignments)
        * All function DECLARATIONS are loaded into memory (no function expressions)
            * Declaration: function dog()
            * Expression: var cat = function()
After Hoisting:
    1. Execution Pass
        * Top to bottom
        * Load assignments in memory as it encounters them
