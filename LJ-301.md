# Learning Journal for CF 301

### Class 1: August 14
Today was our first pair programming exercise for 301. We had to modify starter code to incorporate responsive web design in a blog article. This really just involved creating a 'hamburger' icon menu and making sure the images didn't go outside of the display.  Forking from the class repo through me off when I went to do a PR with my branch to my master, it automatically wants to merge with class repo's master...gotta keep that in mind.  

### Class 2: August 15
Adding content to the DOM with jQuery and worked with a constructor function. The lab took a little over 3 hours, browser kept crashing due to one of the functions in JS code but I thought it was the jQuery script.


### Class 3: August 16
Big lab today, getting an idea of how well jQuery manipulates the DOM but I just don't know the syntax for the traversal yet. Created a 'single-page' application that I'll have to replicate for my portfolio.  Not sure if my portfolio is on schedule or way behind...

### Class 5: August 18
Added a form to the blog to input new articles.  Struggled with it for a while before finding the videos from a previous class that really helped. I can see how useful this could be for adding new blog posts and data to your website.

### Class 6: August 21
Went over lab from Friday, I don't really like the lab style where you just modify small parts of the code I feel like its just a guessing game until you get it to work and but you don't understand why its working or not...

Started learning about AJAX today, looking forward to learning more about how to use these. AJAX - allows page to load data without refreshing
