# Learning Journal for CF 301

### Class 1: August 14
Today was our first pair programming exercise for 301. We had to modify starter code to incorporate responsive web design in a blog article. This really just involved creating a 'hamburger' icon menu and making sure the images didn't go outside of the display.  Forking from the class repo through me off when I went to do a PR with my branch to my master, it automatically wants to merge with class repo's master...gotta keep that in mind.
